Why Airflow?

# Why Airflow?
+ What happens if there is an error at one step of the pipeline? In a perfect world we would not need this tool...
+ What happens if there are like 1k pipelines that we need to manage efficiently?

## Airflow Handles These Problems
+ Cron replacement
+ fault tolerant
+ define dependency rules
+ Python Code definitions (dynamic pipelines)
+ Handle task failures
+ report / alert on failures
+ extensible and modular
+ Really nice UI! (icing on the cake)
